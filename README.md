# 🪉 gharp — GitHub Actions Runner Pool

A self-hosted, Docker-based pool of ephemeral GitHub Actions runners.

> 🍴 **Dogfooded** — this repo's own CI was running on a gharp pool during development!

## ✨ Features

* 🔐 **Self-hosted** — no external service dependency
* ♻️ **Ephemeral runners** — one job per runner, clean environment every time
* ⚡ **Autoscaling** — runners are created on-demand from webhook events
* 📦 **Multi-repository, personal-account support** — share compute across repos (not supported natively by GitHub)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Run gharp

Pre-built multi-arch image: [`muhac/gharp`](https://hub.docker.com/r/muhac/gharp).

```bash
docker run -d --name gharp \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e BASE_URL=https://gharp.example.com \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /tmp/gharp:/tmp/gharp \
  -v gharp-data:/data \
  muhac/gharp:latest
```

`BASE_URL` must be a public HTTPS URL GitHub can reach, terminating at
the container's port 8080 (above mapped to the host's 8080). See
[`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md) for the full env-var reference.

### 2. Create the GitHub App

Open `${BASE_URL}/setup` and click **Create GitHub App**. gharp drives
the GitHub App Manifest flow and persists the credentials locally.

> ⚠️ **Don't rename the auto-generated App name on GitHub.**
> gharp creates the App as `gharp-<hash>`; renaming it changes the slug,
> which breaks the install link gharp renders on `/setup`.
> The webhook keeps working — only the install link goes stale.
> To fix, delete the App on GitHub and re-run `/setup`.

> ⚠️ **`BASE_URL` is sticky.** It's baked into the GitHub App's webhook
> and OAuth-callback URLs at `/setup` time. Changing it later won't
> reconfigure the App — gharp will log a `BASE_URL drift` warning at
> startup. To migrate, re-run `/setup` (creating a fresh App) or revert
> `BASE_URL` to the original value.

### 3. Install the App

Pick the repos (or "All repositories") you want runners for and submit.

> ⚠️ **Self-hosted runners + public repos = remote code execution.**
> GitHub [explicitly recommends against](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-runners/self-hosted-runners/add-runners)
> using self-hosted runners with public repositories: any contributor
> who can open a PR can run arbitrary code on your machine.
> Only install the App on **private** repos you trust,
> and run gharp on a **dedicated VM / cloud instance / homelab node**.
> gharp drops public-repo `workflow_job` webhooks by default. To opt in,
> set `ALLOW_PUBLIC_REPOS=true` for all public repos, or use
> `REPO_ALLOWLIST=owner/repo` to bypass the guard for selected public repos.

### 4. Add a workflow

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "hello from $(hostname)"
```

Every `workflow_job` whose `runs-on` set is fully covered by
`RUNNER_LABELS` (default `self-hosted`; `self-hosted` is implicit on
every self-hosted runner so you don't need to list it) will get a
fresh runner. Jobs requiring a label this pool doesn't advertise are
dropped — see [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md).

For the full deployment guide (from-source build, docker compose,
volumes, upgrades, troubleshooting), see [`docs/deploy.md`](docs/deploy.md).

## Ops APIs

- `GET /healthz` returns `ok`.
- `GET /jobs` returns recent jobs as JSON.
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}` returns full job detail, including stored webhook payload.
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/retry` retries a completed job locally (status resets to pending and is enqueued).
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/cancel` cancels a pending/dispatched job locally.

`/jobs` supports query params:

- `status` (optional): one or more of `pending`, `dispatched`, `in_progress`, `completed`.
  - Repeated form: `?status=pending&status=dispatched`
  - CSV form: `?status=pending,dispatched`
- `repo` (optional): exact `owner/name`
- `limit` (optional): default `100`, max `500`

`/jobs` rows include metadata captured from `workflow_job` payloads such as:

- `job_name`
- `run_id`
- `run_attempt`
- `workflow_name`

Authentication for `/jobs`:

- If `ADMIN_TOKEN` is unset/empty, the endpoint is open.
- If `ADMIN_TOKEN` is set, requests must include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

Examples:

```bash
# Open mode (ADMIN_TOKEN empty)
curl "http://localhost:8080/jobs?status=pending&limit=50"

# Token-protected mode
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8080/jobs?status=pending,dispatched&repo=owner/repo"

# Job detail by GitHub workflow_job.id
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8080/jobs/123456789"

# Local control actions
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8080/jobs/123456789/retry"

curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8080/jobs/123456789/cancel"
```

## 🤔 Why?

GitHub does **not support "user-level" runners**.

* Runners are scoped to: repository, organization, or enterprise

This makes it hard to:

* share a runner across multiple repositories
* use self-hosted runners efficiently in personal accounts
* scale runners dynamically

💡 **This project solves that**

* Uses **GitHub App + webhook (`workflow_job`)**
* Dynamically creates **ephemeral runners per job**
* Automatically cleans up after execution

👉 You get **GitHub-hosted-like behavior on your own machine**

## 🏗️ Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph setup["One-time setup"]
        direction LR
        U[User] -- POST manifest --> GH1[GitHub]
        GH1 -- code + slug --> G1[gharp]
        G1 -- App credentials --> DB[(sqlite)]
        U -- install App --> GH1
    end

    subgraph runtime["Per-job runtime"]
        direction LR
        GH2[GitHub] -- workflow_job webhook --> G2[gharp]
        G2 -- record job --> DB2[(sqlite)]
        G2 -- registration token --> GH2
        G2 -- docker run --> R[ephemeral runner]
        R -- runs the job --> GH2
        R -- one job, then exit --> X((removed))
    end

    setup --> runtime
```

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the full design,
including the GitHub App Manifest flow, sqlite job durability, and
permission scopes.
